Brief Sang Offering to Purify Contamination
by Mipham Rinpoche

hung, nangtong namdak dütsi sang chö di
Hūṃ. Through this smoke offering of amṛta, the purity of appearance and emptiness,
namtok lé jung drib dang mi tsang kün
All contamination and defilement that comes about through thought,
dak sal nyokmé chöku chenpö ngang
Is purified within the experience of the great dharmakāya—pure, clear and unsullied.
sang ngo kunzang dribmé long du ah
Within this unobscured expanse of Samantabhadra, the All Good: Āḥ!

This brief sang offering to purify contamination was composed by Dhīḥ on the sixth day of the
eleventh month of the Wood Dragon year (1904/5).
