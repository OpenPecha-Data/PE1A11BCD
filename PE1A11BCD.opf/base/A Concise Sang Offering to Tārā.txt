Pray come here without impediment or delay.

Along with smoke plumes of offerings, tormas, and other substantial offerings.

May all illness of man and beast be cured and overcome;
charchu beb shing lo chuk lekpa dang
May there be timely rains, abundant harvests and plentiful livestock.

In essence, may we yogins, along with our families and friends,
tsen chuk ngatang chösi tenpa dar
Become influential, powerful and wealthy; may the Dharma teachings spread and communities flourish;
kutsé chösi yar ngö da tar pel
May our lifespan and spiritual and temporal influence grow like the waxing moon;
gong né gong du pelwé tashi shok
And may all be auspicious, so that they continue to expand for evermore!
