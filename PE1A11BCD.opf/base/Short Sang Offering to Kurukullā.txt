Short Sang Offering to Kurukullā
by Mipham Rinpoche

ram yam kham
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ
om ah hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
yeshe dudtsi sang gi düpé trin
I offer plumes of fragrant incense smoke, the nectar of wisdom,
döyön künden kunzang chötrin gyi
Containing all that could be desired, like Samantabhadra’s offering clouds,
rikjé wangmo wang dzé khandro bum
To the majestic Kurukullā and her retinue of hundreds of thousands of seductive ḍākinīs—
sang ngo chö do wang gi ngödrub tsol
This I offer! May it cleanse and purify! Bestow the ability to magnetize, I pray!

Mipham wrote this for Atsang.
